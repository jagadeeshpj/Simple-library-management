# Problem Statement
 <br /> 
Build a simple library management page where <br>
  ● Users should be able to see the list of books <br>
  ○ Instead of loading all the results on the page, perform paging on the list of books – either implement 10 results per page or load on scroll will be a bonus
 <br>  ● Users should be able to filter the list of books based on Title, Author, Subject and Publish - date
<br>   ○ User should be able to see the count of books in based on each criteria [ Title, Author, Subject and publish-date
 <br>
 <br>
